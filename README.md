# Tell Me, Which One is The Most Visually Appealing Image?
This repository is for the implementation of the project "Tell Me, Which One is The Most Visually Appealing Image?" during the semester project of Fall 2021 with the Image and Visual Representation Lab at EPFL. 

----

Each sub-module has its own requirements described respectively, but we propose on the root folder a global requiremens.txt file.
You should first start by creating an environment using this requirement file:

Language: python\==3.7.7

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
