# Tell Me, Which One is The Most Visually Appealing Image?
This repository is for the implementation of the project "Tell Me, Which One is The Most Visually Appealing Image?" during the semester project of Fall 2021 with the Image and Visual Representation Lab at EPFL. 

----
The idea for this project is to lerevage the capabilities of Interactive Image Retrieval o retreave the most suitable and visually appealing image.
Three modules are used for this goal:

- Interactive Image Retrieval: [DCNet](https://github.com/nourGhribi/visiolinguistic-imageSearch/tree/main/DCNET)
- Keyword Exctraction: [Keyword Extracion](https://github.com/nourGhribi/visiolinguistic-imageSearch/tree/main/KeywordsExtraction)
- Image Clustering: [SPICE](https://github.com/nourGhribi/visiolinguistic-imageSearch/tree/main/SPICE)

This code reproduces the result presented in each corresponding paper and some experiments done in the scope of the project.

---
Each sub-module has its own requirements described respectively, but we propose on the root folder a global requiremens.txt file.
You should first start by creating an environment using this requirement file:

Language: python\==3.7.7

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
